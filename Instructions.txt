# Automating-Tinder
Follow the steps: For linux
Firstly install python3: sudo apt-get install python3
Then install PyAutoGUI : pip3 install PyAutoGUI // For automation
Install Tkinter to use mouse info : sudo apt-get install python3-tk python3-dev
Write python3 for activating an ide. Then write following commands
>>> import pyautogui //importing the package 
>>> import time //we want to add a delay after each click
Open up tinder in your browser and place the cursor on the like button to get the co-ordinates. Just leave the cursor on like button and type in terminal: >>> pyautogui.position()
This command will give you the position of like button. Then we have to use a loop.
>>> i = 0
>>> while i<100: //number of times you want to click
...     pyautogui.click(1219,855) // Co-ordinates of like button
...     time.sleep(0.2) //Gap between each click
...     i +=1 //increasing i value eveytime
... 
Hit enter and you would see your Browser doing the job for you.
Cheers!
